# Trunk #

The SVN Trunk on this site contains TFTPgui version 2.x

Any ongoing changes in the Trunk will mainly be to remove any bugs found, and perhaps to improve the code documentation, it is not envisaged that any major features will be added, as the aim of TFTPgui is to be simple.

Version 2 will be compatible with Python 2.5 to 2.7 and will remain so.
